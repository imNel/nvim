# Todo
- lua line theming
- telescope theming
- look into more git plugins
- nvim dashboard
- nvim colorizer
- bufferline with telescope, keybinds to navigate buffers?
- better way to split windows
- netrw replacement/setup? vscode-like tree is convenient but maybe a better alternative. something similar to ranger maybe, telescope file explorer?
- auto switch to right when creating buffer split
- change autocomplete key from enter to something else?
