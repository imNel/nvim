# My nvim Config

## Why?

After trying out a few configs, I found that I liked a few things from all of them, but none of them have fully suited my needs. This config is based on my initial config, when I first tried Neovim but found I didn't have time to maintain my own config.

## Install

Make sure to backup existing configs before cloning!
```
git clone https://github.com/imNel/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim/
```

## Contributing

As configs are a personal thing, I can't guarantee that other's preferences will match mine and therefore PRs and suggestions, while welcomed, will be considered on if I will use it, rather than anyone using the repo, forks are more than okay though!
